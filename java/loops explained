There are mainly 4 type of loops in java.
For loop - this is commonly used when we know the number of iterations before hand , it has 3 parts initialization , condition and update.
Syntax - for(initialization, condition , update)
Eg - this example will print number from 0 to 4 , 5 iterations will be performed.
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}

While loop - this is basically used when , number of iterations are not known and depends on condition to be true to be executed.
Syntax - 
while (condition) {
Code here }
Eg - this loop prints the number until the value of i is less than 5.
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
    i++;
}

For each loop - also called enhanced for loop it is used to iterate through elements of arrays or collections. It is simpler and avoids dealing with index variables.
Eg - This prints the number within the array.
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}

Do-while loop - it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once this happens because the condition is checked after the execution.
Syntax - 
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);

Eg - it does the same task as , only difference is it checks if i 
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
